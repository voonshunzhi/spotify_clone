In simple words, CLASS are files that store variable and fucntion so that you can use it anywhere without the need to repeat the code.

CSS length unit :
- vh
Equal to 1% of the height of the viewport's initial containing block.
-- EG : if 100vh, it will cover 100% of viewport height
- vw
Equal to 1% of the width of the viewport's initial containing block.

*** Imagin margin as BLANK(NO TEXT,NO CONTENT)SPACE OUTSIDE THE ELEMENT, this will clarify a lot of things.

NOTE THAT : The top and bottom margins have NO EFFECT on non-replaced INLINE ELEMENTS, such as <span> or <code>.

CSS position property :
- fixed : relative to the viewport blocks directlu
- relative : relative to its original position
- absolute : relative to it containing block (closest positioned ancestor) which has a position property as well
- These property are used with top, right, bottom,left

Caching problem with CSS : Causes CSS not updating
- Caching is a technique that stores a copy of a given resource and serves it back when requested. When a web cache has a requested resource in its store, it intercepts the request and returns its copy instead of re-downloading from the originating server. This achieves several goals: it eases the load of the server that doesnâ€™t need to serve all clients itself, and it improves performance by being closer to the client, i.e., it takes less time to transmit the resource back. For a web site, it is a major component in achieving high performance. On the other side, it has to be configured properly as not all resources stay identical forever: it is important to cache a resource only until it changes, not longer.

- There are several types of cache :
1) No cache :
- All identical request are going through the server
2) Local cache :
- The 1st request is going throught the server but the subsequent identical request are not even sent but served by local web browser cache.
3) Shared cache :
- 1st request is going through the server, subsequent request are served by a common cache of a web browser.
